# Role
Act as a Senior React UI/UX Engineer specialized in building "Linear-style" SaaS applications. You are an expert in Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons, and clean component architecture.

# Goal
Create the main "App Shell" for a minimalistic note-taking application using a 3-column layout. The design must be pixel-perfect, monochrome, and high-end.

# Tech Stack
- React (Functional Components, Hooks)
- Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling)
- Lucide React (Icons)

# Visual Style Guide (Strict)
- **Colors:** 
  - Backgrounds: `bg-gray-50` (Sidebar), `bg-white` (List/Editor).
  - Borders: `border-gray-200` (Subtle).
  - Text: `text-gray-900` (Primary), `text-gray-500` (Secondary/Meta).
  - Accents: Use `black` or `gray-900` for active states. NO bright colors (blue/green) unless absolutely necessary for alerts.
- **Typography:** Inter/San Francisco style. Tight tracking (`tracking-tight`). Small but readable font sizes (`text-[13px]` or `text-sm` for UI).
- **Spacing:** Dense but breathable. Use `px-3`, `py-2` for list items.

# Requirements

## 1. Layout Structure (Flexbox)
- The main container must be `h-screen w-screen flex overflow-hidden`.
- **Left Sidebar:** Fixed width (`w-[260px]`), `bg-gray-50`, `border-r`. Contains:
  - A "User/Workspace" dropdown at the top.
  - A "Search" button that looks like an input (`bg-white border shadow-sm`).
  - Navigation links (Inbox, Favorites, Trash) using Lucide icons.
  - A section for "Tags" or "Folders".
- **Middle List:** Fixed width (`w-[320px]`), `bg-white`, `border-r`. Contains:
  - Header: "Inbox" title + "Plus" button.
  - Scrollable list of notes.
  - **Note Card:** Should show Title (bold), Preview text (truncated, gray-500), and Date.
  - **Active State:** When a note is selected, the card gets `bg-gray-100` (not blue).
- **Right Editor:** `flex-1`, `bg-white`, `h-full`, `overflow-y-auto`.
  - Content should be centered in a container (`max-w-3xl mx-auto`).
  - Minimalistic Header: Breadcrumbs (e.g., "Inbox / My Note") and "Last edited" time.
  - Large Title Input (`text-4xl font-bold placeholder-gray-300`).
  - Body Text Area (`prose prose-gray`).

## 2. Functional Mock Logic
- Create a `notes` array with 5-6 mock data items (id, title, preview, date, content).
- Use `useState` to track the `activeNoteId`.
- Clicking a note in the Middle List should update the Right Editor view.
- If no note is selected, show a clean "Empty State" in the editor area.

## 3. Micro-Interactions
- Add `hover:bg-gray-200/50` to Sidebar items.
- Add `hover:bg-gray-50` to Note List items (if not active).
- Add `transition-colors duration-200` to all interactive elements.

# Deliverable
Provide a single, complete code block (e.g., `App.tsx` or `NoteApp.tsx`) that renders the full interface. Use clear comments.
