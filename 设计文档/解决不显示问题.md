# Role
React & Tiptap Expert.

# Issue
The user can see the note preview in the Sidebar, but the **Editor body is empty** when switching notes.
This is because Tiptap's `useEditor` only sets the content *on mount*, but doesn't update when the `content` prop changes.

# Goal
Fix `Editor.tsx` to ensure the editor content updates immediately when the user selects a different note.

# Requirements

## 1. Implement Content Sync (`useEffect`)
- inside `Editor.tsx`, add a `useEffect` hook.
- **Dependencies:** `[editor, content]`.
- **Logic:**
  - Check `if (editor && content !== editor.getHTML())`.
  - Execute `editor.commands.setContent(content)`.
  - **Important:** This ensures that when the parent component passes a new note's content, Tiptap renders it.

## 2. Verify Data Flow
- Ensure the `Editor` component props interface accepts `content: string`.
- Ensure the default content isn't overwriting the incoming data.

## 3. Prevent "Cursor Jumping" (Optional but good)
- When using `setContent`, normally the cursor jumps to the start.
- Since this is a "Switch Note" action (not real-time typing sync), jumping to start or just setting content is fine. We just need the text to appear.

# Output
Provide the **corrected `Editor.tsx`** complete code block.
Include comments explaining the new `useEffect` part.
