# Role
Expert UI/UX Designer specialized in "Premium Bento Grid" and "Fluid Design".

# Theme: "Think is Water" (Refining the Gaming Dashboard Aesthetic)
We want to adapt the layout from the reference image (Bento cards, super-rounded corners, dual sidebars) but transform it into a high-end, calm, and professional Note-taking App.

# Goal
Redesign the JD Notes Dashboard using a "Water-inspired Bento Grid" layout.

# Requirements

## 1. The Color Palette (Water & Deep Ocean)
- **Base**: `bg-[#0B0D11]` (Deep dark pond).
- **Cards**: Instead of red, use `bg-white/[0.03]` with `backdrop-blur-2xl`.
- **Accents**: Subtle `text-[#5E6AD2]` (Glacier Blue) and `text-slate-400`.
- **Gradients**: Use very soft, radial gradients (like water ripples) in the background.

## 2. Layout Structure (Bento Logic)
- **Center Canvas**: A grid of cards with different sizes.
  - Large Card: "Current Focus Note" (shows editor preview).
  - Medium Card: "Recent Clippings" (images/code).
  - Small Cards: "Pinned Tags", "Stats: Words Written", "AI Insights".
- **Sidebars**: 
  - Left: Slim icon-only navigation (Glassmorphism).
  - Right: "AI Assistant" and "People" (Floating super-ellipse bubbles).

## 3. Visual Details (The "Water" Touch)
- **Corners**: Extreme rounded corners (`rounded-[2.5rem]`).
- **Borders**: No solid borders. Use `ring-1 ring-white/[0.05]` to simulate light hitting the edge of water.
- **Shadows**: Large, soft shadows with `blur-3xl` for depth.
- **Typography**: Large, elegant titles (Inter, extra light weight) vs small, high-density meta data.

## 4. Interactive Feel
- Cards should have a subtle "floating" animation (framer-motion).
- Hovering over a card should trigger a "Liquid expansion" effect.

# Deliverables
1. A React component structure for this "Bento Dashboard".
2. Tailored CSS for the "Ice/Water" glass cards.
3. A layout configuration that balances "Information Density" with "Visual Calm".
