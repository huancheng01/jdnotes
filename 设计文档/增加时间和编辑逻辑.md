# Role
Senior React UX Engineer.

# Context
We are refining the Editor behavior.
Current issues:
1. When switching notes, the editor stays in "Edit Mode" if it was previously active. The user wants to start in **"View Mode" (Read-only)** by default when opening a note.
2. The user wants to see `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps in the Editor header.

# Goal
Update `Editor.tsx` and `App.tsx` to handle state resetting and metadata display.

# Requirements

## 1. Feature: Default to View Mode
- In `Editor.tsx`:
  - Listen for changes to the `noteId` (or the unique identifier of the note).
  - Use a `useEffect` hook: When `noteId` changes, set `isEditing` to `false`.
  - **Exception:** If possible, when clicking the "+" (New Note) button in the Sidebar, we *do* want to start in Edit mode. (Optional: You can add an `initialEditMode` prop, but simple resetting to false is the priority).

## 2. Feature: Display Dates
- **Props Update:** Update `EditorProps` to include `createdAt: Date | number` and `updatedAt: Date | number`.
- **UI Implementation:**
  - In the Header area (above or near the Title), add a metadata row.
  - Format the dates cleanly (e.g., "YYYY年MM月DD日 HH:mm").
  - **Style (Linear Style):** Use `text-xs text-gray-400 font-medium`.
  - Layout: Flex row, maybe separated by a bullet point (•).
  - Example text: "创建于 2024/01/01 • 最后修改于 10:30"

## 3. Component Updates
- **`App.tsx`**: Pass the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields from the `activeNote` to the `Editor` component.
- **`Editor.tsx`**: Render the new date section.

# Deliverables
Provide the updated code for:
1. `Editor.tsx` (Focus on the `useEffect` for state reset and the Header rendering).
2. The usage snippet in `App.tsx` (how to pass the props).
