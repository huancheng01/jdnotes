# Role
Expert UI/UX Designer & Frontend Architect (Linear, Apple, Vercel aesthetic specialist).

# Design Philosophy: "Think is Water"
The app must feel fluid, transparent, and calm. Minimize hard lines. Use depth, blur, and sophisticated typography.

# Goal
Refactor the entire UI of JD Notes to achieve a high-end, premium aesthetic based on the "Think is Water" theme.

# Requirements

## 1. Global Refinement (The Water Texture)
- **Backgrounds**: 
  - Light: `bg-[#F9FBFC]`.
  - Dark: `bg-[#0B0D11]`.
- **Surfaces**: Sidebar and AI Chat should use `backdrop-blur-md bg-white/60 dark:bg-black/40` to create a translucent, water-like feel.
- **Borders**: Replace `border-gray-200` with `border-black/[0.03]` (light) or `border-white/[0.06]` (dark).

## 2. Typography & Breath (Clarity)
- **Font**: Use 'Inter' or 'SF Pro' with `tracking-tight`. 
- **Editor**: Increase `max-w-4xl` for the editor but add more horizontal padding (`px-16`). The title should feel monolithic but light.
- **Hierarchy**: Use `text-slate-900` for titles and `text-slate-400` for meta-info (like dates).

## 3. Sidebar & AI Chat (Fluid Components)
- **Sidebar**: Remove the solid background. Use a very subtle gradient that fades from left to right.
- **Note Items**: Active state should not be a solid gray box. Use a subtle "Elevation" effect: `bg-white shadow-[0_4px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.03)] dark:bg-white/[0.03]` with a tiny 2px vertical "indicator" on the left.
- **AI Chat Sidebar**: 
  - Messages should look like they are floating. 
  - AI bubbles: `bg-indigo-50/50 dark:bg-indigo-500/10` with soft rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`).
  - Input bar: A floating "Pill" at the bottom with a strong `backdrop-blur`.

## 4. Icons & Accents
- **Icons**: Thin weight icons (Lucide weight 1.5px).
- **Accent**: Use a sophisticated "Deep Sea Blue" (`#5E6AD2`) for active stars and key actions.
- **Scrollbars**: Make them invisible or extremely thin and rounded.

## 5. Micro-interactions
- Add a soft fade-in animation to the Note List when switching.
- Buttons should have a `scale-95` tap effect.

# Deliverables
1. A refined `App.tsx` layout structure with the new color classes.
2. Updated CSS for the `ProseMirror` (Editor) to make the text feel elegant and centered like a high-end publication.
3. Updated `AIChatSidebar.tsx` with the "Floating/Translucent" UI.

# The "Water" Signature
Add a subtle CSS "glass" overlay to the top header of the editor so the text scrolls "under" it with a blur effect.
