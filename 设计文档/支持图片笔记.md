# Role
React & Tiptap Expert.

# Context
We are adding Image support to our "Linear-style" Note App.
Since we are using Dexie.js (Local-First), we will use **Base64 encoding** for images for simplicity (MVP phase).

# Goal
Enable users to:
1. **Paste** images from clipboard directly into the editor.
2. **Drag and Drop** images into the editor.
3. See images rendered with proper styling (rounded corners, shadows, max-width).

# Requirements

## 1. Library Installation
- Use `@tiptap/extension-image`.

## 2. Editor Configuration (`Editor.tsx`)
- Import and register the `Image` extension in the `useEditor` hook.
- **Configuration:**
  - `inline: false` (We want block-level images mostly).
  - `allowBase64: true` (Critical for pasting without a server upload handler).

## 3. Styling (Linear Style)
- We need to target the `img` tag inside the editor using Tailwind Typography or global CSS.
- **Style Rules:**
  - `max-w-full` (Responsive).
  - `h-auto` (Maintain aspect ratio).
  - `rounded-xl` (Modern radius).
  - `shadow-sm` (Subtle depth).
  - `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800` (Subtle container).
  - `my-6` (Vertical spacing).

## 4. Feature: "Insert Image URL" (Optional)
- Add a helper function `addImage` that prompts for a URL (using `window.prompt` is fine for now) and inserts it.
- Hook this up to a button in the Editor Header or Command Menu (if applicable), but Pasting is the priority.

# Deliverables
1. `npm install` command.
2. The updated `extensions` array for `Editor.tsx`.
3. The specific CSS/Tailwind classes to ensure images look professional and don't overflow.

# Note on UX
Tiptap handles the drop/paste events automatically once the extension is active. No custom event handlers are needed for Base64.
